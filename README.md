# Revoir

Reimagining sight for those who need it

## Outline

This README serves as a navigation point to access multiple materials related to this project. Apart from the actual code, the README will hold links to the (constantly updating) plan for the project, any research, requirements, developments and evaluation that will occur when producing the app. It will document the entire journey of the project, from start to finish.

## Reasoning

An important question is "Why are you building this in the first place?" 

There are multiple reasons, but mainly the first thing is that I have experienced first hand a friend struggling with their visual impairment and how it affected their quality of life. The loss of sight meant they had to struggle with small tasks that seem mundane to most people, such as requesting bigger texts for everyday things, or not being able to shop without having to squint and bend down to read tiny labels. As well as this, they also experience issues with things such as pin readers, making tasks such as managing their money independtly complex.

Creating an app that would help to elevate these struggles, even by a little bit, is something that I've always wanted to do.
