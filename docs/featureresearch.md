# Feature Research

From rnib.org.uk:

    Blind and partially sighted people can use apps to perform everyday tasks with an enhanced degree of independence.

    They can allow someone with sight loss to read printed materials like letters, magazines and menus, to recognise currency, find out the colour of an item, to identify products using a bar code reader, find out what is around you and hear descriptions of what a scene looks like. The also help to make travelling from one place to another easier using GPS to provide directions, information on landmarks and roads.

From this we can see that some features the app could include is reading out printed materials, recognising currency and finding out colours of items. To find out items using a barcode scanner might be quite difficult to implement with my current skills. I will also no include GPS right not, but it might be something that can be considered in further development of the app.

Another key problem is limitation to see things at a distance. One feature might be allowing the user to tap on an object they want to see closer and the camera zoom in on it?

Important things such as traffic signs are also a major part of being visually impaired that people struggle with. Traffic sign identification might be something that we can include in the app.
