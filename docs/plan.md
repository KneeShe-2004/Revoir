# Plan

## Intial thoughts

The purpose of the app is to create an interface that would allow visually impaired people to feel more at ease when navigating the world by themselves. Before I can even get to creating the app, there are plans and research that need to be done into the field.

It makes sense to come up with a list of requirements, but to do so I would need to use investigation techniques. The most beneficial way of gathering requirements would be to either hold an interview/survey, but this might be quite difficult to do since I do not have access to a wide age demographic (especially as the target audience of the app would be likely to be people who are old) so online research might have to be the best way to do this.

It is also important to do some market research into the topic - some questions to consider might be
<ol>
    <li> Are there similar apps out there?</li>
    <li> Is there an actual need for the app?</li>
    <li> What types of features would people like to see in the app?</li>
    <li> Is there anything new I could add that doesn't already exist in pre-existing apps?</li>
</ol>

Research will also need to be done into what frameworks and other languages I would need to use for this project. It being cross platform is crucial to reach a wider audience.

### Market Research

This [markdown](../docs/marketresearch.md) holds the found market research

From the market research conducted, we can see that many similar apps do exist in the field, however they are not exactly what my apps want to do. Using GPT-4 might be a way to implement the ai section as mentioned in the market research.

### Feature research

This [markdown](../docs/featureresearch.md) holds the found feature research

From the feature research, the following features can be identified:

<ol>
    <li> Read printed material </li>
    <li> Find out the colour of an item </li>
    <li> Letting the user tap on an area of the screen to zoom in on </li>
    <li> Identification of traffic signs </li>
    <li> Telling the user what they're seeing infront of them </li>
</ol>

### Framework Research

This [markdown](../docs/frameworkresearch.md) holds the found framework research

From the framework research conducted, the framework I have decided to use is Flutter. Flutter allows me to learn a new language, as well as learning a new framework. Although using Cordova would have been comfy, I think it's important for me to step outside of my comfort zone as well.
