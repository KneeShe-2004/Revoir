### Be My Eyes

Be my eyes is an app that is centred around volunteers helping people and acting as their eyes by calling through the phone screen. Although this is marginally different to my idea, one interesting aspect is that they have recently created a 'Virtual Volunteer Tool' that's powered by OpenAI's GPT-4. Their website states that the app uses image-to-text where users can send images to the app which will then provide identification and interpretation.

This although similar, is still slightly different to the aim of my project. Rather than sending an image to the app, I was envisioning a live video feed which identifies the items by highlighting them in-real time with a narrator reading off what it says. This calls into question if the app design is too ambitious? And if so, do I need to find some other way to do it?

It might also be advisory to use GPT-4, considering it is powerful AI that's already trained on data I might need for this project.

### Seeing AI

Seeing AI is an app made by microsoft that does many things. Some things include describing the scene around a person, recognises emotions, identifies currency bills when playing amongst many more things. The app works by switching between channels and is based on narration of the world around the user. This is similar to what my app wants to do, and I might take some inspiration from it.

On the other hand, I also envision the app to not only give audible output, but also to highlight what the thing the camera is looking at and describe it in bigger letters. This is important because it's a key feature that discerns my vision from others.
